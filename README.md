# BlogGen AI

BlogGen AI is a web-based application that leverages advanced NLP through LLaMA 2 and the Huggingface endpoint (via LangChain) to generate high-quality blog posts. With a user-friendly Streamlit interface, users can input a topic, select tone, target audience, word count, and style preferences to generate a fully formatted blog post complete with an estimated read time. Additionally, the application integrates web search functionalities—initially via DuckDuckGo and later upgraded to the Tavily Search API—to enrich content with dynamic, contextually relevant information.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

```
       [User]
         │
         ▼
  [Web Browser (Streamlit UI)]
         │
         ▼
  [Backend Python Server]
         │
         ▼
  [Huggingface Endpoint via LangChain] <--> [LLaMA 2 Model]
         │
         ▼
  [Web Search Tools (DuckDuckGo/Tavily Search API)]
         │
         ▼
  [Content Processing & Formatting Module]
         │
         ▼
  [Final Blog Post Display]
```

This design ensures that the UI, processing, and content generation components interact seamlessly to deliver a robust user experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package installer)
- A virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bloggen-ai.git
   cd bloggen-ai
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes packages such as:
   - Streamlit
   - LangChain
   - Requests
   - Additional libraries for handling API calls and data processing

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`. Fill in the form with your desired blog topic, tone, target audience, word count, and other settings, then submit to generate your blog post.

3. **Interacting with the UI:**

   - **Input Form:**  
     Provide details like blog topic, tone, and target audience.
   - **Dynamic Content Generation:**  
     The backend processes the input via the Huggingface endpoint, enriches content with integrated web search, and outputs a formatted blog post.
   - **Post-Generation Options:**  
     Review, edit, or download the generated content directly from the interface.

## Configuration

Create a configuration file (e.g., `.env`) in the root directory to manage API keys and other environment-specific settings:

```
# Huggingface API credentials
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key

# LangChain configuration
LANGCHAIN_CONFIG=your_langchain_configuration

# Web Search API keys (if applicable)
DUCKDUCKGO_API_KEY=your_duckduckgo_api_key  # if required
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

Ensure you load these environment variables in your application startup script.
